# Media-Technology-Career-Day
Website for Media Technologies Career Day 2016

#### Description
This website was a part of the Media technology career day project of 2016. I have been working on developing this alone, with some external inputs from Gabriella Sanchez Karlsson who made the icons and Sofia Blomgren and Linnea Holm who contributed with photographs.

#### Techniques
The techniques used are AngularJS - in order to establish a MVC hierarchy, some jQuery, and CSS. The project also contains some logic towards the instagram API and a  SQL database.
